- 👋 Hey there, I’m sirrele! 
  - aka
    - @gitfitbro
    - @immortalmathgod
    - @sirrele_
- 👀 I’m interested in GitFitCode, Foster Care, and Group Theory
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to pause and predict if writing down what I am going to stay would be a better option. I also would like to level up as a business investor. I think the Brave Security team sets an amazing bar to aspire too!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on community building and third party integrations
- 📫 How to reach me on our GitFitCode community discord!
